# Numbers in lists by SeanMc from forums
# define a procedure that takes in a string of numbers from 1-9 and
# outputs a list with the following parameters:
# Every number in the string should be inserted into the list.
# If a number x in the string is less than or equal 
# to the preceding number y, the number x should be inserted 
# into a sublist. Continue adding the following numbers to the 
# sublist until reaching a number z that
# is greater than the number y. 
# Then add this number z to the normal list and continue.

#Hint - "int()" turns a string's element into a number
